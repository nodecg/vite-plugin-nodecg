# [vite-plugin-nodecg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-nodecg)

### Vite plugin to enable its use with NodeCG

Generates .html files for your graphics and dashboards so they use the Vite dev-server in development, and load assets directly in production.

## Why?

Webpack and Parcel are slow. Vite is reeeeally fast, but its dev server can't emit files to disk (kinda by design), so NodeCG can't add in it's client-side script.

`vite build --watch` emits the build to disk on source update but doesn't give you HMR. Using this plugin you get the full Vite experience.

## Setup

1. Install the plugin in your bundle: `npm i -D vite-plugin-nodecg`
2. Install the plugin in your `vite.config.mjs` (see example below)
3. Either:
    - a: Configure `vite-plugin-nodecg` to match your bundle's structure (again see below)
    - b: Use the default configuration and create 2 template.html files, `./src/graphics/template.html` and `./src/dashboard/template.html`
4. Run `vite` for development or `vite build` for production

## Default behaviour

By default `vite-plugin-nodecg` will load all .js and .ts files in `./src/graphics` and `./src/dashboard` (not nested), using the templates `./src/graphics/template.html` and `./src/dashboard/template.html` respectively.

### Minimal `vite.config.mjs`

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import NodeCGPlugin from 'vite-plugin-nodecg'

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [NodeCGPlugin()],
})
```

### Why `.mjs`?

`globby` now only supports ESM files, so for now your vite config will need to be in this format (if your bundle is using `"type": "module"` you can just use `.js` or `.ts`). See [#8](https://github.com/Dan-Shields/vite-plugin-nodecg/issues/8).

## Custom `vite.config.mjs`

If you want a specific graphic/panel to have its own template, use a different path for the templates, or have the entry points in a different structure, you can specify this with the `inputs` field in the plugin options. The keys of which are the glob expressions to find inputs, and the values are the corresponding templates to use.

### Supported input patterns

`vite-plugin-nodecg` uses the globby library to find and match inputs, the supported patterns of which can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/globby#globbing-patterns).

### Input ordering

When determining which input to use, `vite-plugin-nodecg` will iterate top to bottom in the `inputs` section of the config and use the first one it comes across. Hence why in the example below `special_graphic` has to come before `graphics/*/main.js`, otherwise that would match first.

### Source directory & file structure

`<bundle-dir>/src` is the default base path for any input files found inside, such that the input's path relative to it is reflected in the output directory of the .html file, e.g. the input `<bundle-dir>/src/graphics/graphic1/main.js` will html file output to `<bundle-dir>/graphics/graphic1/main.html`. Any inputs inside who's first sub-directory relative to `<bundle-dir>/src` is _not_ `graphics` or `dsahboard`, will not be picked up by NodeCG and (probably) pointless.

If you want `vite-plugin-nodecg` to look in a different directory to `./src` for your input files, specify this using the `srcDir` config option.

### Example

The following config is for a bundle with a separate `templates` directory, which has a `special_graphic` with a `special_template`, and which nests each input in its own sub-directory (e.g. `src/graphics/timer/main.js`).

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import NodeCGPlugin from 'vite-plugin-nodecg'

export default defineConfig(() => {
    return {
        plugins: [
            NodeCGPlugin({
                inputs: {
                    'graphics/special_graphic/main.js':
                        './templates/special_template.html',
                    'graphics/*/main.js': './templates/graphics.html',
                    'dashboard/*/main.js': './templates/dashboard.html',
                },
            }),
        ],
    }
})
```

### Default plugin options

```javascript
{
    inputs: {
        'graphics/*.{js,ts}': './src/graphics/template.html',
        'dashboard/*.{js,ts}': './src/dashboard/template.html',
    },
    srcDir: './src'
}
```

## Testing

### To manually test:

- ensure the latest version of the plugin has been built locally and exists in `/dist`
- clear out the `dashboard`, `graphics` and `shared` directories from the `test/test-bundle`
- run `pnpm build` in `test-bundle` and examine the built files
- the new files should be identical to the committed ones
- for development, run `pnpm dev` and for now a manual review of the built files is required

## Todo

- ~~Write tests~~ Automate the diff-test and consider unit tests. See [#9](https://github.com/Dan-Shields/vite-plugin-nodecg/issues/9)
- ~~Investigate other template setup possibilties~~ (see [#2](https://github.com/Dan-Shields/vite-plugin-nodecg/issues/2))
